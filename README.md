# ML-Inspired-Microwave-Imaging-for-phantom-based-tumor-Detection
This project uses CST simulations with two custom antennas and numerical phantoms to generate microwave images for tumor detection. We created 1200 synthetic images with masks and trained both Random Forest and CNN models to classify tumor vs no-tumor cases.
